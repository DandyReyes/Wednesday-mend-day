Hello everyone!

I am new to GitHub and love coding. I am a student in LACC and am pursuing a degree in Software engineering. I want to do the best that I can, to do the best work I can. I hope you will teach me alot.

Also, question. Do you think you need an degree to code for either a big or small company?
